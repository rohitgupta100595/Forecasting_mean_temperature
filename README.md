# Forecasting_mean_temperature
This repository contains a project that forecast future mean temperatures based on future regressors.

The dataset used in the project contains daily Delhi climate data from 2013 to 2017. This dataset provides data from 1st January, 2013 to 24th April, 2017.
This project uses Prophet model to forecast the temperatures.

This project demonstrates the following:

-> Data Preparation

-> Data Cleaning

-> Outlier Detection

-> Exploratory Data Analysis

-> Time Series Analysis

-> Parameter Tuning

-> Model Building with Tuned parameter

-> Data Visualization
