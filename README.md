# Forecasting_mean_temperature
This repository contains a project that forecast future mean temperatures based on future regressors.
This project uses Prophet model to forecast the temperatures.

This project demonstrates the following:

-> Data Preparation

-> Data Cleaning

-> Outlier Detection

-> Exploratory Data Analysis

-> Time Series Analysis

-> Parameter Tuning

-> Model Building with Tuned parameter

-> Data Visualization
